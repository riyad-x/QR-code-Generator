# QR-code-Generator
A QR code generator is a tool that creates QR codes, which are square, matrix-style barcodes. These codes can store various types of data, such as URLs, text, contact details, and more. By scanning a QR code with a smartphone or QR code scanner, users can quickly access the encoded information without manually typing it in.
